## Shaders

<sup>_more info over at the [Shaders](Shaders) folderâ€¦_</sup>

## Installation

1. Head over to the [Actions] tab and click on the latest entry;
2. navigate to Artifacts and download "reshade-shaders";
3. extract the downloaded archive somewhere and move the "Shaders" and "Textures" folders into your ReShade installation's "reshade-shaders" folder;
   - If you don't have a "reshade-shaders" folder you most likely don't have ReShade installed, as such, click on the colorful icon at the top-right and download the ReShade setup files.
4. launch your game, or if you have it already launched, click the "Reload" button and the shaders should be installed.
